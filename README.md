#### Before I started coding
I studied Philosophy, Neuroscience, and Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, focusing on questions about how people learn and make decisions. I hope to apply my software development skills to some of these questions, to build tools that encourage us to be more mindful consumers of information and nurture our epistemic agency.
