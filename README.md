#### Hello ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Kelly Dinneen. I am a javascript developer and a student in the Frontend program at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://frontend.turing.io/).

*I have a knack for communicating complex ideas, a love of learning, and an ever-growing curiosity about human-technology relationships.*

Reach out if you could use a competent developer with a creative bent -- I am especially excited about ethically or aesthetically visionary projects that are reimagining the way we learn and interact online.

#### Before I started coding
I studied Philosophy, Neuroscience, and Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, focusing on questions about how people learn and make decisions. I hope to apply my software development skills to some of these questions, building tools that nurture our epistemic agency.

#### ðŸ§  Right now, I **CAN** 
- create interactive web apps with React and React Router (using React Hooks)
- manage state with Redux
- write clean ES6 Javascript (make it asynchronous!)
- build an end-to-end testing suite with Cypress
- unit test with Mocha or Jest
- construct a custom REST API with Express.js and Node.js
- visualize data with D3.js, Charts.js, and Leaflet.js
- Write Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
- Manage a team's workflow with GitHub issues, projects, and pull requests
- Use a merge or rebase workflow

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m **LEARNING** 
- Typescript
- GraphQL
- database configuration with SQL
- creative coding with P5.js and Paper.js
- cloud hosting with Digital Ocean
- containerization with Docker
- Thunk and Saga patterns for Redux
