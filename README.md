### My name is Kelly Dinneen 👋

I'm a javascript developer.

#### 🧠 Right now, I **can** 
- create interactive web apps with React and React Router (using React Hooks)
- manage state with Redux
- build an end-to-end testing suite with Cypress
- unit test with Mocha or Jest
- construct a custom REST API with Express.js and Node.js
- visualize data with D3.js, Charts.js, and Leaflet.js
- Write Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
- Manage a team's workflow with GitHub issues, projects, and pull requests
- Use a merge or rebase workflow

#### 🌱 I’m **learning** 
- Typescript
- GraphQL
- database configuration with SQL
- creative coding with P5.js and Paper.js
- cloud hosting with Digital Ocean
- containerization with Docker
- Thunk and Saga patterns for Redux

#### Before I started coding
I studied Philosophy, Neuroscience, and Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, focusing on questions about how people learn and make decisions. I hope to apply my software development skills to some of these questions, to build tools that nurture our epistemic agency.
